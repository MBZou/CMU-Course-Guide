This class provides an emphasis on part-writing principles and analysis of harmonic function and form.

## Homeworks

There are homeworks that are due every class, starting with fundamentals, which teaches you the basics of music, with clefs, scales, chords, key signatures, etc.
Then the homeworks transition to part-writing and then analysis is added which is due with every part-writing assignment, in which (Non harmonic tones) NHTs are labeld with the harmonic function. 
Later, function analysis will also be required in the part-writing and analysis assignments, where you follow the phrase model. Form will also be addressed, which
is similar to the analysis assignments, but, instead of labeling harmonic function and NHTs, you label it based on the relationships between phrases in a work.

## Checkoff

There are weekly checkoffs, which are due a class before the part-writing and analysis. You either receive full or no credit based on doing them,
this is a great way to collaborate with other classmates and discuss idioms used.

## Exams

The midterm consists of fundamentals, part-writing, and analysis. The final includes everything in the midterm plus form analysis and more chords to use.

## Lectures

Attendance is always taken. Lectures include lecturing on the use of a particular chord in part-writing, idioms of specific chords, part-writing exercises,
analyzing works, which may include pop culture.

## Fulfillments
 
This course counts as a Humanities and Arts elective in SCS, CIT, and MCS. It is also a required course for music majors including BXA Music majors,
and music minors. 

## Applicability

Course content is not particularly aligned to any technical field, but students with an interest in music theory and composition may find it interesting.  

## Prior Experience

Students must take a harmony placement test to determine which harmony course they should be enrolled in. If students pass the placement
test, they will be put in an assigned section of Harmony I. Section A is the highest level, and Sections C and D are lower level, for beginner musicians.
